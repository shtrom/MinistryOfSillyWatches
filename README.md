= Ministry of Silly Watches =

A silly watchface for Pebble smart watches.

![A tribute to John Cleese by goonofhazzard on DeviantArt][silly-walk]

Inspired by the [Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch][wp-silly-walks],
and in the ilk of [some physical watch][tg-silly-walk-watch], this watchface
uses the actual steps of John Cleese's gait to show the time.

Though reordered for better legibility (look where the lifted foot is pointed),
the postures indicate the hour, and the cane points to the minutes.

![It is 2.37-ish][screenshot]

A short double vibration is also given every hour.
